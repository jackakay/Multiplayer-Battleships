Once a player creates a game, they go into the ready screen where an opponent can join at any time, if they dont join before theyve
finished placing their boats, after the player presses ready it checks every 5 seconds to see if the other player has joined and keeps 
sending requests until the opponent is also ready. They then take turns playing.
